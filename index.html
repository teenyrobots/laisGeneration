			<div id="aboutCopy"><p>"We know very little about Marie de France besides her name, her work, and her position as the first major woman writer in medieval Europe. She composed the lais (short verse stories that resemble fairy tales) sometime between 1160 and 1199."</p>

			<p>Marie de France wrote parables about love in medieval times. They often included some kind of "lesson" or moral, but mostly served as an investigation of different kinds of feelings and relationships between people. They ranged from fairytellesque to the absurd. She wrote about idealized love, emotional love, and physical love using an almost stock cast of characters and settings to investigate these ideas.</p><div>
